Logging for C (LogC)
====================

This is library for C for logging. It is able to output to any stream (file,
socket, stdout, ...) as well as to syslog. It optionally outputs colors and source
code line.

It is loosely designed close to Python logging but is intended to be versatile in
C and primarily easy to use no matter if you are writing library or application.

This library tries to introduce minimum amount of additional dependencies to be as
simple to include as possible.
